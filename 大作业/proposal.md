1.  Introduction

    1.  *Social Anxiety Disorder*

Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is a highly frequent disorder with a life-time prevalence of up to 12.1% (Kessler et al., 2005). “Persistent fear of one or more social or performance situations in which the person is exposed to unfamiliar people or to possible scrutiny by others” and the fear to be embarrassed or humiliated are described as the main symptoms; such situations are commonly avoided or undergone with intense fear or distress (according to DSM-5, Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (5th ed.), 2013) (American Psychiatric Association & American Psychiatric Association, 2013). The etiology and maintenance of the disorder might be explained by automatic cognitive biases in the processing of social information (Morrison & Heimberg, 2013; Wells et al., 1995). Hypervigilance-avoidance models describe hypervigilance in terms of an initial attentional bias to threatening stimuli, e.g. angry faces (Gilboa-Schechtman et al., 1999; Mogg et al., 2004), followed by avoidance of these (Bögels & Mansell, 2004). Moreover, patients are more likely to interpret ambiguous stimuli negatively and underestimate the likelihood of upcoming positive events (Heinrichs & Hofmann, 2001); even positive feedback is associated with negative affect (Wallace & Alden, 1997).

1.  *Attention Bias towards Negative Emotional Faces*

SAD patients exhibit a pronounced attentional bias toward negative emotional faces, particularly those expressing anger and fear, which is seen as a characteristic of SAD and plays a significant role in the development and maintenance of the disorder. Current studies show that individuals with high social anxiety show a strong tendency to direct their attention toward negative emotional faces, such as angry and fearful expressions. This bias is evident in both adults and children with social anxiety (Pishyar et al., 2004; Stirling et al., 2006; Waters et al., 2011). Also, they often exhibit a lack of bias toward positive emotional faces, such as happy expressions, which further accentuates their focus on negative stimuli (Garcia et al., 2019; Yang & Baek, 2022).

2.  *Memory Bias for negative information*

In addition to the attention bias toward negative emotional faces, SAD patients also have a memory bias for negative information, like autobiographical memory and social feedback (Glazier & Alden, 2019; Romano et al., 2020). People with high social anxiety tend to recall more negative autobiographical memories and have a higher degree of generalization in these memories compared to those with low social anxiety (Gong et al., 2023; Krans et al., 2014). SAD individuals recall positive social feedback as less positive over time, indicating a fading positivity effect, suggesting that their memory for positive social events deteriorates more quickly than for negative events (Glazier & Alden, 2017). While explicit memory tests (e.g. free recall) may not always show significant differences, implicit memory tests (e.g. word recognition tasks) reveal that socially anxious individuals have a higher priming effect for threat-relevant information (Memarian & Azaraein, 2016). Some researchers suggest that memory biases in SAD are linked to the preferential processing of threat-relevant information, which can be a result of both attentional focus on negative stimuli and impaired discrimination of social cues (Groch et al., 2017; Qi et al., 2017). And the tendency to engage in negative post-event processing (i.e. ruminating on perceived social failures) further reinforces the memory bias towards negative information (Morgan, 2010).

3.  *Memory Bias for Negative Emotional Faces?*

Given that SAD patients’ attention bias towards negative emotional faces and memory bias for negative information, the question arises whether there is also a memory bias for those negative emotional faces. While studies on verbal material do not support a memory bias in SAD (Heinrichs & Hofmann, 2001), there are only a few studies on behavioral memory effects for faces, and these yield controversial data: in an incidental learning paradigm, participants with SAD recognized critical faces better than accepting faces, while healthy controls showed the opposite pattern (Coles & Heimberg, 2005; Lundh & Öst, 1996). However, participants with SAD showed worse recognition of angry faces after a supraliminal dot-probe task (LeMoult & Joormann, 2012). Other studies applied explicit learning paradigms. Foa and colleagues found generally better memory for same pictures of faces in SAD compared to healthy controls (HC), which was even more pronounced for negative faces (Foa et al., 2000). In an explicit learning study for facial identities by D’Argembeau and colleagues, participants learned emotional faces and were later asked to recognize the same and novel persons now showing a neutral facial expression. Low socially anxious participants had better memory for happy faces while there was no effect of facial expression in high socially anxious participants (D’Argembeau et al., 2003). These inconsistent findings may be explained by the very different designs. But more critically, in these experiments it was not necessary to pay addition attention to negative emotional faces to do the task, which means they don’t really treat these faces as negative faces.

1.  *Attribute Amnesia*

Attribute amnesia (AA) refers to the counterintuitive failure to report an attended stimulus's attributes immediately after the stimulus presentation, despite having processed the attribute for a different task (Chen & Wyble, 2015). This definition shows the core characteristic of AA, where attention and awareness of a stimulus do not necessarily lead to the formation of a durable memory trace for that stimuli (Fu et al., 2023).

Studies have shown that AA can occur with different types of stimuli, including facial expressions, suggesting that the phenomenon is not limited to simple or abstract stimuli (Chen et al., 2019). They found that participants had difficulty identifying a negative emotional face they had just attended, with faces might repeat in different trials. Moreover, studies indicated that AA still remained even the target faces are not repeated throughout the experiment (Tam et al., 2021). Since the occurrence of AA with facial expressions is discovered, AA paradigm is an excellent method to measure whether SAD patients have memory bias towards negative emotional faces to which they have to pay attention. Thus, we propose our first question:

**Q1: *Will SAD patients perform better in identification task in surprise trial?***

H1a: *SAD patients’ performance in identification task in surprise trial is better than normal people.*

H1b: *SAD patients’ performance in identification task in surprise trial is the same as normal people.*

To ensure the probable significant result is not due to the paradigm itself, we have to exam AA effect using other complex stimuli except for emotional faces (below we assume that H1a was supported):

**Q2: *Whether SAD patients’ better performance in identification task is due to the paradigm itself?***

H2a: *SAD patients’ better performance in identification task is not due to the paradigm.*

H2b: *SAD patients’ better performance in identification task is due to the paradigm.*

2.  Exp 1

Exp 1 aims to investigate whether SAD patients memorize the faces they attend to better than normal people.

1.  *Methods*

    1.  *Design*

Normal control group and SAD experiment group perform traditional AA paradigm with emotional faces as stimuli. SAD control group perform traditional AA paradigm with other complex pictures as stimuli.

2.  *Participants*

The trinomial test(Bian et al., 2011) will be used in data analysis. For each sample size, data were simulated to generate the most conservative estimate of statistical significance such that *N*_(d)/*N* = 0.3 and n₋ approaches its maximum possible value. At *N* = 40, with *N*_(d) = 12, *n*₊ = 26, *n*₋ = 14, simulated *p* = 0.040. Thus, we plan to recruit 40 participants from a University in China and 80 participants who were diagnosed as social anxiety disorder using DSM-5-TR. The three groups will be matched in terms of gender ratio. In addition, students from the University who report other mental disorder will be excluded. Participants will receive either partial course credit or money for their participation.

3.  *Materials*

For normal group and SAD experiment group, the emotional face stimuli in Experiment 1 consists of 20 distinct images sourced from the **NimStim Set of Facial Expressions** (Tottenham et al., 2009), see **Figure 2**. These are categorized into five distinct emotional expressions: happiness, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness, with four different actresses portraying each expression. Among these, four of the happy faces are used as distractors, while the remaining 16 faces, representing negative emotions, serve as target stimuli. Each trial includes one target negative face paired with three distractor happy faces, with each face in a trial depicted by a different actress. For SAD control group, 16 images are used, consisting of black-and-white line drawings sourced from a picture database (Snodgrass & Vanderwart, 1980). Of these, four images of furniture (e.g., a bed) are selected as target stimuli, while the remaining 12 images depicts common objects encountered in daily life (e.g., a boat) and serve as distractor stimuli. Each stimulus subtends the same visual angles as faces. All images are presented against a neutral background to minimize external visual influences. All stimuli are presented against a neural background (RGB: 128, 128, 128). The reason we don’t exchange the target face and distractor face in experiment group as the stimuli for SAD control group is

that, it is likely the unsignificant result in SAD control group is due to their attention being captured by distractors (e.g. negative emotional faces), thus they perform worse in remember positive faces.

4.  *Procedure*

The trial sequence is shown in **Figure 3**. Each trial begins with a black fixation cross centered on a white background, displayed for a random interval between 500 and 1,500 ms. This is followed by the presentation of the search array, which lasts for 2,000 ms. In the array, one target negative emotional face (e.g., fearful, angry, or sad) and three distractor happy faces are arranged in a square pattern, with each face placed 200 px from the fixation cross. The exact sizes and positions of the stimuli are determined by the resolution of the participant’s computer screen. The target and distractor face locations are randomly varied across trials. Following the search array, a blank delay of 500 ms occurs.

Arriving at the laboratory, participants will first give written informed consent. Then they will be briefed on the pre-surprise trial of attribute amnesia (AA) task, where they are required to identify the location of a target facial expression (e.g., fearful face) among a set of distractor faces (e.g., happy faces). After that they are set to do the task without practice trials.

In the first 27 trials, a location screen appears after the delay, assigning numbers (1, 2, 3, 4) corresponding to the locations of the faces in the search array. Participants are asked to identify the location of the target negative emotional face by entering the corresponding number and are given immediate feedback on their response. On trial 28, the surprise trial, an unexpected task is presented after the delay. The target face, along with three new faces (all

| ![](media/image6.png) |

| **Fig. 3** **A)** Trial sequence in priming trials in Exp 1 with faces as stimuli. |

negative emotional expressions from the same pool), are randomly arranged in a horizontal line, with numbers (5, 6, 7, 8) below them. Participants are asked to identify which of these faces matched the emotional expression of the target face they had just seen in the previous search array. After this surprise question, participants are prompted to report the location of the target face using the same number prompt they had encountered in earlier trials. Trials 29–32 follows this new pattern, serving as control trials to assess any changes in performance after the surprise task. For clarity, the exact wording of the questions used in the task can be found in **Figure 3**.

For SAD control group, the entire procedure is the same, except for the stimuli, which are some black-and-white line drawings of objects.

After the task, participants will complete a brief questionnaire assessing their subjective experience of the task, including perceived difficulty and emotional reactions.

1.  *Data Analysis*

Because the data observed in this experiment is within-subject count data, a trinomial test will be utilized. This variation of the binomial test that takes the occurrence of ties into consideration and quantifies performance over time by binning outcomes into three groups: *n*₊(positive change from timepoint 1 to timepoint 2), *n*₋(negative change), and *n*₀(no change). In the context of a surprise trial paradigm, *n*₊ participants are those who were incorrect on the surprise trial but correct on the first control trial, *n*₋ participants were correct at surprise but incorrect on the next trial, and *n*₀ participants were either correct or incorrect on both trials. The test statistic for a trinomial test, *N*_(d), is the difference between *n*₊ and *n*₋. A one-tailed trinomial assessed for the presence of a significantly positive *N*_(d), indicating a deficit in surprise trial performance. A 95% bootstrapped Confidence Interval around *N*_(d) is also provided.

Trinomial test will be used to exam the difference of identification task between surprise task and the first control task. The hypotheses of Q1 and Q2 are easy to be evaluated according to the statistic result:

1)  If trinomial test is significant in normal control group and SAD control group, while not in SAD experiment group, H1a and H2a will be supported.

2)  If trinomial test is significant in normal control group, while not in SAD experiment and SAD control group, and chi-square test between SAD experiment and SAD control group is significant, H1a will be supported and H2a will be supported to some degree.

3)  If trinomial test is significant in normal control group, while not in SAD experiment and SAD control group, and chi-square test between SAD experiment and SAD control group is not significant, H1a will be supported but H2a will be rejected.

4)  If trinomial test is significant in normal control group and SAD experiment group, H1a will be rejected.

3.  Discussion

    1.  *Contributions*

        1.  *Theoretical Expansion*

        2.  *Methodological Innovation*

    2.  *Limits*

        1.  *Limitations of Indicators*

It is discussed that relying solely on behavioral data (such as accuracy rate and reaction time) makes it difficult to gain insights into the deep-seated cognitive processes of the subliminal. By comparing with studies that combine multimodal measurements such as electroencephalogram (EEG) and eye-tracking, the insufficiency of single behavioral indicators in understanding the mechanism of attention bias is elaborated. Behavioral indicators alone can only provide surface-level information about participants’ responses, while multimodal measurements can offer a deeper understanding of the underlying cognitive processes.

2.  *Operation of Attention Bias*

Since we are focused the impact of HSA patients’ attention bias on memory bias, what could be conducted is that we manipulate patients’ attention bias. Nowadays, there several ways to modify HSA patients’ attention bias, like Attention Bias Modification (Fitzgerald et al., 2016; Ollendick et al., 2019; Yuan et al., 2024), Adaptive Attention Bias Modification (Amir et al., 2016), Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (Niles et al., 2013; Tolin, 2010) etc. With the help of different modification method, we can further investigate the impact of attention bias of HSA patients on their memory bias.
