# Exp 1

**Objective**

The aim of Experiment 1 is to identify high and low social anxiety groups . Participants who score in the top 37% of the social anxiety scale will be assigned into the high social anxiety (HSA) group, while those in the bottom 37% will be assigned to the low social anxiety (LSA) group. These participants will then be randomly selected through stratified random sampling to participate in Experiment 2, Experiment 3, or Experiment 4. For example, if the intended participant distribution for Experiments 2, 3, and 4 is in a 1:1:1 ratio, the top 3 participants based on their social anxiety scores will be randomly assigned to Experiment 2, Experiment 3, or Experiment 4. Researchers will  the selected participants to attend the corresponding experiment.

**Participants**

In Experiments 2 and 3, paired sample non-parametric tests and chi-square tests will be used for analysis. Using G\*Power 3.1, a chi-square test was selected with the following parameters: alpha = 0.05, 1-beta = 0.8, w = 0.3, df = 1. The minimum required sample size was calculated to be 88, meaning that 44 participants from the HSA group and 44 participants from the LSA group will be needed. A review of the sign test table shows that when N = 40, the absolute difference in the ratio of $r_+$ and $r_-$ can reach 0.3 when the non-parametric test is significant. Therefore, Experiments 2 and 3 will aim to recruit 90 participants, with 45 participants from the HSA group and 45 from the LSA group. For Experiment 4, paired sample *t* test and mixed-design ANOVA will be used, and the minimum sample sizes for significant *F* test (*N* = 34) and *t* test (*N* = 27) calculated via G\*Power 3.1 are both smaller than the sample size required for chi-square tests. As a result, Experiment 4 will also recruit 90 participants. Overall, Experiments 2 and 3 will need to recruit 135 participants from the HSA group and 135 from the LSA group, totaling 270 participants. Based on these calculations, Experiment 1 should collect at least 365 valid data.

In all experiments, participants must be between the ages of 18 and 30 and report no history of neurological or psychiatric disorders that could interfere with memory or attention. Participants will be excluded if they report a history of head injuries, substance abuse, or are currently using medications that affect the central nervous system.

**Materials**

Social anxiety levels will be measured using the Chinese version of the **Social Interaction Anxiety Scale (SIAS)**. The Chinese version of the SIAS ([Ye et al., 2007](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016503272032807X?pes=vor&utm_source=scopus&getft_integrator=scopus#bib0070)) is based on the English version ([Mattick & Clarke, 1998](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016503272032807X?pes=vor&utm_source=scopus&getft_integrator=scopus#bib0040)). Participants will be asked to rate each statement on a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 (extremely uncharacteristic of me) to 5 (extremely characteristic of me). The total score from the 20 items on the SIAS will serve as an indicator of social anxiety, with higher scores indicating stronger social anxiety. After completing the SIAS, participants will be required to report whether they have a history of head injuries, substance abuse, or are currently using medications that affect the central nervous system.

# Exp 2

**Objective**

The primary objective of Experiment 2 is to investigate whether individuals with high social anxiety perform better on the attribute amnesia (AA) task than individuals with low social anxiety. This experiment seeks to explore the relationship between social anxiety and memory for emotionally salient stimuli, with a focus on how anxiety may influence the ability to remember facial expressions.

**Participants**

We will contact 45 participants from the HSA and LSA groups based on the results of Experiment 1, asking them to come to the laboratory for the experiment.

**Materials**

The emotional face stimuli in Experiment 2 consists of 20 distinct images sourced from the **NimStim Set of Facial Expressions** (Tottenham et al., 2009), see **Figure 1**. These are categorized into five distinct emotional expressions: happiness, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness, with four different actresses portraying each expression. Among these, four of the happy faces are used as distractors, while the remaining 16 faces, representing negative emotions, serve as target stimuli. Each trial includes one target negative face paired with three distractor happy faces, with each face in a trial depicted by a different actress. The visual angles of the face stimuli are 3.21° horizontally and 3.44° vertically. All stimuli are presented against a neural background (RGB: 128, 128, 128).

**Procedure**

The trial sequence is shown in **Figure 1**. Each trial begins with a black fixation cross centered on a white background, displayed for a random interval between 500 and 1,500 ms. This is followed by the presentation of the search array, which lasts for 2,000 ms. In the array, one target negative emotional face (e.g., fearful, angry, or sad) and three distractor happy faces are arranged in a square pattern, with each face placed 200 px from the fixation cross. The exact sizes and positions of the stimuli are determined by the resolution of the participant’s computer screen. The target and distractor face locations are randomly varied across trials. Following the search array, a blank delay of 500 ms occurrs.

Arriving at the laboratory, participants will first give written informed consent. Then they will be briefed on the presuiprise trial of attribute amnesia (AA) task, where they are required to identify the location of a target facial expression (e.g., fearful face) among a set of distractor faces (e.g., happy faces). After that they are set to do the task without practice trials.

In the first 27 trials, a location screen appears after the delay, assigning numbers (1, 2, 3, 4) corresponding to the locations of the faces in the search array. Participants are asked to identify the location of the target negative emotional face by entering the corresponding number and are given immediate feedback on their response. On trial 28, the surprise trial, an unexpected task is presented after the delay. The target face, along with three new faces (all negative emotional expressions from the same pool), are randomly arranged in a horizontal line, with numbers (5, 6, 7, 8) below them. Participants are asked to identify which of these faces matched the emotional expression of the target face they had just seen in the previous search array. After this surprise question, participants are prompted to report the location of the target face using the same number prompt they had encountered in earlier trials. Trials 29–32 follows this new pattern, serving as control trials to assess any changes in performance after the surprise task. For clarity, the exact wording of the questions used in the task can be found in **Figure 1**.

After the task, participants will complete a brief questionnaire assessing their subjective experience of the task, including perceived difficulty and emotional reactions.

# Exp 3

**Objective**

Experiment 3 is designed to determine whether individuals with high and low social anxiety perform differently on an attribute amnesia (AA) task when presented with non-emotional, complex stimuli. This experiment aims to rule out the possibility that the differences observed in Experiment 2 are due to variations in task performance rather than memory for emotional faces specifically. In Experiment 3, only the stimuli are changed, while the overall experimental design remains consistent.

**Participants**

The participant recruitment procedure for Experiment 3 is the same as Experiment 2. The participants in Experiment 3 will not overlap with those in Experiment 2.

**Materials**

For this experiment, 16 images are used, consisting of black-and-white line drawings sourced from a picture database developed by Szekely et al. (2005) and other researchers (Abbate & LaChappelle, 1979; Snodgrass & Vanderwart, 1980). Of these, four images of furniture (e.g., a bed) are selected as target stimuli, while the remaining 12 images depicts common objects encountered in daily life (e.g., a boat) and serve as distractor stimuli. Each stimulus subtends visual angles of approximately 2.52° horizontally and 2.52° vertically. All images are presented against a neutral background to minimize external visual influences.

### Exp 4: 

**Objective**
 In Experiment 4, we aim to explore whether the difference in performance between the HSA and LSA groups in the AAT is driven by differences in attention or by the types of information retained in working memory. Specifically, we hypothesize:

1. **Increased Attention**: The HSA group may demonstrate longer fixation times, indicating greater attention to emotional faces during the task.
2. **Selective Memory Encoding**: Alternatively, the two groups may exhibit similar fixation times, but the HSA group may encode a higher proportion of face identity information in working memory, as compared to location information.

By using eye-tracking technology, we will gather key data on gaze duration and fixation patterns, which will help support these two potential explanations.

**Participants**
The participant recruitment procedure for Experiment 4 is the same as Experiment 2. The participants in Experiment 4 will not overlap with those in Experiment 2 and Experiment 3.

**Materials**
The same emotional face stimuli used in Experiment 2 will be used in experiment 4, featuring a mix of positive and negative emotional expressions. The experimental setup will also include an EyeLink Portable Duo eye-tracking system (SR Research, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada), which will record monocular eye position with a sampling rate of 1000 Hz. Eye movement data will be used to analyze gaze behaviors and fixation patterns during the task.

**Procedure**
The general experimental design of experiment 4 will follow the same structure as experiment 2, with adjustments to incorporate eye-tracking data collection:

Before the task, participants will be fitted with the **EyeLink Portable Duo** system. A 5-point calibration procedure will be performed to ensure accurate tracking of eye movements. During the task, participants will be instructed to focus on the faces displayed on the screen, and the eye tracker will continuously record their gaze patterns.

**Eye Movement Analysis**: Eye movement data will be analyzed to examine the fixation durations and the distribution of attention across the faces. Key metrics such as **fixation time** (how long participants look at each face) and **gaze duration** (the total time spent on a particular stimulus) will be compared between the two groups. Additionally, we will analyze whether the proportion of face identity information in working memory is higher in the HSA group, based on both their responses and eye-tracking data.
